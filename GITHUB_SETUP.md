# Setup Instructions for GitHub Repository Creation

To complete this task, I need your GitHub authentication information.

## Option 1: Provide GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
4. Generate and copy the token

## Option 2: Create Repository Manually

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Name: `xtts-finetune-egyptian`
3. Description: "Fine-tuning XTTS v2 for Egyptian Arabic using Egy-Speech-DeepClean"
4. Select "Public" or "Private" as desired
5. Click "Create repository"
6. Copy the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/xtts-finetune-egyptian.git`)

Once you've created the repository, let me know and I'll push the code to it.
